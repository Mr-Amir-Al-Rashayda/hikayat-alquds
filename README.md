# Hikaya Quds · حكاية القدس

An AI-powered personalized guide and living-memory archive focused exclusively on
Jerusalem’s historic quarters, gates, souqs and surrounding neighbourhoods. The
Arabic-first interface supports smart walking itineraries, grounded storytelling,
natural narration, exact-place photography, community memories and offline fallback.

The stories are built **only** from reviewed content. When the records do not cover
something, Hikaya says so instead of filling the gap.

---

## Quick Start

For the quickest offline-ready demo, only the frontend is required:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. If the backend is not running, the interface clearly
switches to the bundled Jerusalem data; the map, stories, quiz and planner still work.

For the complete stack, use three terminals from the repository root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — grounded AI module
cd ai && python3 -m service.server --port 8001

# Terminal 2 — API (uses the in-memory Jerusalem seed when PostgreSQL is absent)
cd backend && npm install && cp -n .env.example .env && npm run start:dev

# Terminal 3 — web app
cd frontend && npm install && cp -n .env.example .env && npm run dev
```

To enable the more human online narration, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in
`frontend/.env` and restart the frontend. Without the key, the app says that it is
using the best Arabic voice installed on the device instead of silently sounding
robotic.

With PostgreSQL (optional, recommended):

```bash
createdb hikaya
psql -d hikaya -f database/schema.sql
psql -d hikaya -f database/seed.sql
psql -d hikaya -f database/seed-generated.sql
echo 'DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/hikaya' >> backend/.env
```

### Android

```bash
cd android
./gradlew installDebug
```

Nothing else to configure: the complete reviewed archive - every place, story,
timeline, quiz and 34 photographs - ships inside the APK, so the app is fully
readable with no backend and no connection. Point it at a running API from
Settings when you want live contributions and server-side generation.
See [`android/README.md`](android/README.md).

## Features

- Illustrated Jerusalem map with Old City walls, four named gates, surrounding
  neighbourhoods, route numbering, category filters and visited-site markers
- Arabic-first interface with full RTL behavior and the local Thmanyah font family
- Personalized itinerary wizard with duration/interests, optimized stop ordering,
  walking time, distance, compass direction and live walking-direction links

## The Rule That Shapes the Design

The AI never invents historical facts. It simplifies, rewrites and summarises reviewed
content, and nothing else.

That is enforced, not just stated:

- Content enters only through `content/ai-ready/`. A location with no reviewed summary
  gets a refusal, not a story from general knowledge.
- Religious traditions and oral heritage are stored separately from documented facts
  and must always be attributed.
- Generated text is checked for numbers and proper nouns that do not appear in the
  source; anything unmatched is flagged for a human.
- Gaps come back as uncertainty notes shown next to the story.
- Generated stories and user contributions both land in a review queue. Neither
  reaches a reader without an editor.
- Photographs are real pictures of the actual sites, each shown with its
  photographer and licence. A then-and-now comparison is only offered where the
  archive holds two photographs of the *same* subject.

## Current Status

The first integrated prototype works end to end: the frontend reads live data from the
backend, the backend reads PostgreSQL, and story generation runs through the AI module
against the reviewed content files.

Each part also runs alone, and says so when it does — the backend falls back to seeded
in-memory data, the AI module to an offline generator that only reuses source
sentences, the frontend to bundled sample data behind a visible banner. No fallback
pretends to be the real thing.

The current Q GUIDE build contains the eight Jerusalem locations, Arabic and English
interfaces, reviewed Arabic generation fallbacks, exact-place licensed media, route
planning and progress souvenirs. The editor review interface, authentication and
direct media upload remain outside this prototype; contribution moderation is already
enforced by status and reference code.
