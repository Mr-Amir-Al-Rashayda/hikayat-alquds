# AI Module

Turns reviewed Jerusalem heritage content into simplified, engaging narratives,
and answers visitor questions from the same material.

## The One Rule

**The AI module never invents historical facts.** It simplifies, rewrites,
reorganises and summarises reviewed content, and nothing else. If the material
needed to answer a request is not present, it says so instead of filling the gap.

Everything in this folder is built around enforcing that:

- content can only enter through `content/ai-ready/` (`content_loader.py`);
- unreviewed content is refused outright (`models.py`);
- religious traditions and oral heritage are kept separate from facts and must be
  attributed (`prompts.py`, and the content structure itself);
- output is checked for numbers and proper nouns that are absent from the source
  (`fact_guard.py`);
- gaps are reported as `uncertainty_notes` rather than filled.

## Quick Start

No installation, no API key, no network:

```bash
cd ai
python3 -m service.cli story muslim-quarter --audience student
python3 -m service.cli ask bab-al-amud "Which period built the present gate?"
python3 -m service.cli locations
```

Run the tests:

```bash
cd ai
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run the HTTP service the backend talks to:

```bash
cd ai
python3 -m service.server --port 8001          # no dependencies
# or, with dependencies installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn service.app:app --port 8001
```

Then point the backend at it with `AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8001`.

## Two Generation Backends

| | Offline extractive (default) | Model backend |
|---|---|---|
| Enabled when | always | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set and `anthropic` is installed |
| How it writes | reassembles sentences taken from the reviewed summary | prompts a language model under the strict system prompt |
| Can it invent a fact? | No, by construction | No, by instruction — and the fact guard checks |
| Deterministic | Yes | No |
| Used for `ai/examples/` | Yes | — |

The model backend falls back to the extractive one on any failure — missing key,
network error, rate limit, empty reply. `model.provider` in the response always
says which one actually ran, so nobody has to guess.

This is why the feature works today with nothing installed, and gets better prose
the moment a key is available.

## Audience Modes

| Mode | Who it is for | Length |
|---|---|---|
| `student` | school or university, educational tone | 180–320 words |
| `tourist` | a visitor standing at the site | 160–300 words |
| `child` | roughly ages 8–11, simple sentences | 90–170 words |
| `short` | a summary of at most five sentences | 45–110 words |
| `historian` | a reader who knows the period; full chronology, no simplifying | 220–400 words |
| `general` | default balanced register | 150–280 words |

`child` mode additionally drops any material mentioning sieges, destruction, war
or killing, and records that it did so in the uncertainty notes — the history is
not hidden, it is just not in the child-facing text.

## Using It From Python

```python
from service import generate_story, StoryRequest

response = generate_story(StoryRequest(
    location_id="muslim-quarter",
    target_audience="tourist",
))

print(response.title)
print(response.narrative)
print(response.uncertainty_notes)   # what the source could not support
print(response.warnings)            # what the fact guard flagged, if anything
```

## Samples

`examples/` holds one generated sample per MVP location, plus short-mode and
historian-mode samples and a set of Heritage Guide questions. Each sample records the input location,
target audience, the generated story, and the notes about limitations and missing
information. They are regenerated, never hand-edited:

```bash
cd ai && python3 scripts/generate_examples.py
```

## Planned Features Not Yet Built

- Arabic output. The content files are Arabic; the summaries and generator are
  English-only so far, and `language: "ar"` currently returns
  `unsupported_language`.
- Contribution analysis — summarising user submissions and suggesting a category
  before human review.

## The Heritage Guide's Offline Limits

Without a model configured, `ask-guide` is a keyword retriever. It never invents -
it returns sentences that exist in the reviewed content - but it can still return
a loosely related passage. Two rules keep it honest:

- a question whose content words are mostly absent from the records gets a refusal
  rather than an answer ("the best falafel shop here" used to come back with the
  city gates, because *best* appears in *best known*);
- when only part of a question matched, the response says which words were missing.

A follow-up question is understood by folding the previous question into it. Earlier
turns are context for reading the question and never a source of facts - there is a
test asserting a fabricated previous answer cannot leak into a new one.
