# Content Module

Reviewed historical and cultural material for the eight Hikaya Quds locations. Everything the
AI module is allowed to say about a location comes from this folder — nothing else.

## The Three Kinds of Material in This Folder

### 1. Reviewed location records (`ai-ready/*-summary.md`)

Structured, editor-reviewed records, one per location. They are the canonical factual
source used by the AI module, the timeline export and the visitor-facing bibliography.
Keeping one reviewed record per place prevents a stale draft from silently becoming a
second source of truth.

Each summary has a fixed shape so the AI service can parse it:

- YAML frontmatter: `location_id`, `name`, `arabic_name`, `city`, `country`,
  `latitude`, `longitude`, `category`, `language`, `reviewed`, `source_file`,
  `last_reviewed`
- `1. Short Overview`
- `2. Key Historical Timeline`
- `3. Cultural and Religious Importance`
- `4. Main Landmarks`
- `5. Important Facts`
- `6. Religious Traditions` — *never to be presented as historical fact*
- `7. Oral Heritage and Popular Stories` — *never to be presented as historical fact*
- `8. Source Notes` — including the explicit list of gaps the AI must not fill

`location_id` must match the `id` used in `database/seed.sql` and in the backend API
(`muslim-quarter`, `christian-quarter`, `armenian-quarter`, `maghariba-quarter`,
`sheikh-jarrah`, `silwan`, `at-tur`, `bab-al-amud`), because that is how the backend picks the right
summary when it calls the AI service.

### 2. Media (`media/media.json`)

No image, audio, or video files are stored in this repository. `media/media.json`
records the photographs shown in the galleries by URL, and it is the single source
of truth for them: `ai/scripts/export_seed_data.py` generates the database, backend
and frontend copies from it.

Every entry carries:

| Field | Why it is required |
|---|---|
| `subject` | What the photograph actually shows, e.g. `Damascus Gate` |
| `caption` | One sentence for the gallery |
| `era` | `modern` or `historical` — an 1880s plate and a phone photo say different things |
| `pair_role` | `cover`, or `before`/`after` for a then-and-now comparison |
| `credit`, `license`, `license_url` | These are other people's photographs, used under licences that require attribution |
| `date` | The capture date the source gives, ranges included |
| `source_url` | The Commons page, so anyone can check |

The export script refuses to build if an entry lacks a credit or a licence, if its
declared `era` contradicts its date, or if a before/after pair shows two different
subjects. Preference order for sources: Wikimedia Commons (clear licensing, stable
URLs), then official institution galleries, then anything else with its licence
recorded.

**Check the photograph before adding it.** The metadata says what a file is called,
not what it depicts; the current set was reviewed on a contact sheet, and one image
was still caught later carrying the wrong era.

### 3. Quiz (`quiz/quiz.json`)

Comprehension questions shown after a story. Each needs `options`, an
`answer_index`, an `explanation`, and a `source_note` naming where in the reviewed
content the answer comes from — a quiz that only says "correct" is asking to be
trusted.

### Source notes inside every reviewed record

Every AI-ready location record ends with reviewed source notes that contain:

- direct links to the reliable references the file was built from,
- the media reference table,
- **source notes**: the review status, the known gaps in the material, and any naming
  conflicts or points where sources disagree.

The same gaps are repeated in section 8 of the matching AI-ready summary, because that is
the copy the AI module reads.

## The Fact / Tradition / Oral-Heritage Separation

This is the single most important rule in this folder, and it exists to keep the AI from
turning a tradition into a historical claim.

| Category | Definition | How the AI must present it |
|---|---|---|
| **Historical facts** | Backed by academic or archaeological sources — dates, buildings, rulers, UNESCO listings. | May be simplified and rephrased. Nothing may be added. |
| **Religious traditions** | Accounts tied to belief — "according to Christian tradition", "according to Islamic belief". | Always attributed to the tradition, never stated as established fact. |
| **Oral heritage / popular stories** | Accounts passed down locally and not historically verified. | Presented as oral heritage, with a note that it is not confirmed. |

Concrete examples already handled this way:

- Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj — recorded under Islamic religious tradition rather than
  rewritten as an archaeological claim.
- Traditions associated with Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives — attributed to
  the relevant Christian tradition instead of presented as independently proven dates.
- Community memories from Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah — retained as oral heritage and
  separated from the documented architectural and municipal record.

## How This Folder Is Consumed

```
content/ai-ready/<location>-summary.md

        ▼
ai/service/content_loader.py     parses frontmatter + sections
        │
        ▼
ai/service/story_generator.py    builds the prompt from the summary only

[`docs/integration-guide.md`](../docs/integration-guide.md) for the end-to-end flow.

## Adding a New Location

1. Write the reviewed location record in `content/ai-ready/<slug>-summary.md`, keeping the eight
   sections and the frontmatter. The timeline table becomes the location's timeline.
2. Use the same `location_id` in `database/seed.sql`.
3. Add photographs to `content/media/media.json` and questions to `content/quiz/quiz.json`.
4. Run `python3 ai/scripts/export_seed_data.py` to regenerate the three seeds — it
   validates as it goes.
5. Run `python3 ai/scripts/generate_examples.py` to produce a sample story and confirm the
   summary parses correctly.

## Hikaya Quds 2026 Status

- AI-ready summaries: present for all eight Jerusalem locations.
- Timeline, licensed media and source-cited quiz seeds: generated into PostgreSQL,
  NestJS in-memory repositories and frontend offline mocks from the same content sources.
- Fact / tradition / oral heritage: separated in every AI-ready summary.
